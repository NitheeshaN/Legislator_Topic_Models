Abstract:
Statistical topic modeling is used extensively in the study of text in digital politics. Documents of interest to researchers vary considerably in length, from very short (e.g., tweets) to quite long (e.g., speeches, website contents). There is open debate in the literature regarding how document length relates to the interpretability of topic models. We explore the implications of aggregating relatively short documents into larger documents based on a natural unit that partitions the corpus. In our primary example, we analyze a sample of one million tweets posted by U.S. state legislators between April 1st 2016 and September 30th 2020. We study the impact of document definition on results of topic modeling. Our primary result is that, when documents are defined through aggregation of content at the account level, topics are more associated with individual states than when documents are defined as tweets. We replicate this finding in a second study of Wikipedia pages of people, aggregated to their birth cities. Our results illustrate how document definitions can alter the findings in topic modeling.
